Detecting white blood cells (WBC) in microscopic  images is essential in medical diagnosis. Manual analysis of these  images is time-consuming and has a high error rate. Using object  detection for WBCs detection with deep convolutional neural  networks (CNN) can be considered a practical and effective  solution.
